# Smith College Personalized STEM Major Quiz

## Description of the project & how to run it:
  This project is a quiz game that guides the player through a series of academic scenarios in order to find the STEM major at Smith College that best suits their interests. For each scenario, the player has to choose one of the three possible responses pertaining to whether or not they enjoyed the activity, and each response will increment/decrement the associated counter(s). The counters represent the possible STEM majors that the player can receive as a result. Once all of the scenarios have been completed, the player is presented with the values of the final counters, their best match major, and the option to view or skip the major requirements. They can replay the game as well.

## Necessary packages/modules:
  The necessary modules are the graphics module (download link: http://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/binaries/Python/putInSitePackages.zip or included in the file graphics.py) and the math module (built-in Python module).

## List of known bugs:
  When the repl is run for the FIRST time, because of the appearance of the window's title bar at the top, all the features in the window will be moved down a little bit, causing the text at the bottom to be possibly cut off.
  For the best experience with the quiz game, it is suggested that it be played when the repl is run from the SECOND time onwards, because then the title bar of the window will disappear, and every feature in each window will appear as normal (i.e. in the correct intended position).
