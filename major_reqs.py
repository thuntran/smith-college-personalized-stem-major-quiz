• New for AY 2020-2021 only: one required course and its associated lab (if applicable) may be taken S/U and still count toward completion of the biochemistry major.  In consultation with their academic and/or pre-health advisor(s), students should carefully evaluate the possible downstream ramifications of taking a specific course S/U, since it may impact applications for graduate or medical training programs.

• You are advised to complete all the following foundational courses before your junior year: BIO 132/133, 202/203, CHM 111, 222, 223, and 224 or 118, 222, and 223, and BCH 252/253.

THE TRACKS

Students electing to major in Biology will be asked to identify the pathway through the major that most closely matches their interests. These pathways, or tracks, are described briefly below:

\033[1m• Track 1: Integrative Biology\033[0m
This track provides the broadest training in the biological sciences, requiring students to complete at least one course in each of the subdivisions of contemporary biology including Ecology/Evolution, Cellular and Systems Biology, Molecular biology and Genetics.   

\033[1m• Track 2: Cells, Physiology and Development\033[0m
This track emphasizes intermediate levels of biological organization, including the cell, organ systems, integration and homeostasis, and the emergence of phenotype from the interactions of genes, cells and tissues.

\033[1m• Track 3: Genetics, Evolution and Molecular Biosciences\033[0m
This track emphasizes the transmission of information within and across generations, mechanisms of inheritance and the modification of genetic information, the centrality of evolution as the explanatory paradigm in living systems, the experimental, analytic and computational tools and techniques of genetics and genomics.

\033[1m• Track 4: Biodiversity, Ecology and Conservation\033[0m
This track emphasizes the emergence and organization of ecosystems at all scales, their stability and response to perturbation, the 3.5 billion-year history of diversity on this planet, the rich quantitative theory that accounts for the dynamics of populations, species and ecosystems and the application of these principles to contemporary challenges including climate change and biodiversity loss.

\033[1m• Track 5: Biology and Education\033[0m
This track is intended for students interested in a secondary school teaching career emphasizing the life sciences. Graduates receive a degree in biological sciences and may be able to complete the requirements for a Massachusetts teaching license for high school and middle school biology. Students combine coursework in the Department of Education and Child Studies with courses in this department meant to provide students with a strong background in key concepts in contemporary life sciences. While this track still requires the same total number of 12 courses to satisfy a biology major, careful selection of additional courses outside the major will be required to prepare you for completion of a MA state teaching licensure. Students interested in this track should contact the coordinator of teacher education as soon as possible.​

\033[1m• Track 6: Self-designed track in life sciences\033[0m
This track is available, under exceptional circumstances, to students wishing to craft a coherent trajectory through the curriculum that is not otherwise met by existing tracks. Students undertaking this track must work closely with their advisor, and petition the department for prior approval."""

***Notes on course substitutions:
• CSC 111 may be replaced by a 4 or 5 on the AP computer science exam.
• SDS 220 or SDS 201 may be replaced by a 4 or 5 on the AP statistics exam. Replacement by AP courses does not diminish the total number of courses required for either the major or the minor (see Electives above). Any one of ECO 220, GOV 203, PSY 201, or SOC 204 may directly substitute for SDS 220 or SDS 201 without the need to take another course, in both the major and minor. Note that SDS 220 and ECO 220 require Calculus. Students should be aware that substituting for SDS 220 or SDS 201 could leave them without R programming experience, which is needed in subsequent courses, such as SDS 290 & 291.
• MTH 211 may be replaced by petition in exceptional circumstances.
• Five-College equivalents may substitute with permission of the program.
• SDS 107 and EDC 206 are important courses but do not count for the major or the minor.
• An Honors Thesis (SDS 430D) generally cannot substitute for the capstone SDS 410."""
